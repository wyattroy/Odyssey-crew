# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-25)

**Core value:** The commons tension must actually fire — disaster emerges from the sum of private, individually-reasonable choices, while cooperation stays optimal for *winning* (favor) and defection stays optimal only for *bare survival*.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Effect Engine & Sequential Resolution

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Effect Engine & Sequential Resolution)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-25 — Roadmap created for milestone v1.1 (4 phases, 29 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: v1.1 is additive/refactor-friendly — extend existing `beats`/resolver, single `rng()` seam, and `LAND_TABLE`/`SEA_TABLE`/`reskin` data patterns; never a rewrite.
- Roadmap: Effects-as-balance — the hand-tuned per-stage deltas ARE the balance retune (no simulation harness this pass); validated via a fixed multi-seed 0-human auto sweep.
- Roadmap: Anchor retrofit (Hades/Phaeacia/Ithaca) is scoped as an engine-extension task, distinct from island content authoring, and must not regress validated v1.0 mechanics.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Known death-spiral (project memory `odyssey-crew-playtest-balance`): default constants produce a hold-economy collapse. Phase 3's multi-seed sweep is the exit gate that must confirm it is fixed and not over-corrected into trivial survival.
- HARD constraint on every phase: single self-contained `index.html`, vanilla JS, no libraries/build/network/storage; `?seed=` determinism and the 0-human unattended run must survive each phase.

## Deferred Items
